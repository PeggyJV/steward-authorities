# DEPRECATED - Steward Registry

This is a deprecated registry for recording Sommelier Validators' Steward information needed by Strategy Provider clients to establish a secure connection.

Registration is now handled by the [x/pubsub module](https://github.com/PeggyJV/steward/blob/main/docs/05-PubsubForValidators.md).
